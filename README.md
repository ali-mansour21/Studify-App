> Studify: A mobile app designed to improve student learning by making it easy to share and access study materials. Our goal is to help students and teachers connect and learn better through technology.
>
> Studify helps students learn more by providing a simple way for teachers to upload study materials, including PDFs with questions and answers. Students can find and use these materials, ask questions, and get answers based on the content. The app encourages students to share materials. Using technology like OpenAI and Firebase, Studify makes communication fast and learning more effective for everyone.

### User Stories

### Studify is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- The backend database uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its robustness, performance, and standards compliance.
- Notifications within the app are managed through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), specifically Firebase Cloud Messaging. This service allows for reliable and scalable delivery of notifications to devices across platforms.
- ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS.

   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Install Flutter dependencies for the mobile application
   ```sh
   cd mobile
   flutter pub get
   ```
5. Enter your Firebase API key in the configuration file for the mobile app
   ```sh
   const FIREBASE_API_KEY = "ENTER YOUR FIREBASE API";
   ```
6. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
